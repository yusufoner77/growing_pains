# growing_pains

This program implements a dynamic array data structure that can store integers. In this version of the dynamic array, the array should grow in size by one every time a user tries to add an integer to the array when it is already full.

In order to run this program, you must be able to compile and run C++ programs on your machine.

To run the program:
```bash
g++ DynamicArray.cpp ArithmeticDynamicArray.cpp GeometricDynamicArray.cpp main.cpp && ./a.out
```
